                     HTTPS/REST

##  Security

### Implemented Security Measures

 **Authentication**
- JWT-based token authentication (30-day expiry)
- Bcrypt password hashing (10 salt rounds)
- Secure password validation (min 6 characters)

 **Authorization**
- Role-based access control (Admin, HR, Employee)
- Company-based data isolation
- Protected routes with middleware verification

 **Data Protection**
- Company-specific filtering on all queries
- Ownership verification before updates/deletes
- Prevention of role escalation attacks
- Input validation and sanitization

 **API Security**
- CORS protection with origin whitelist
- Rate limiting on sensitive endpoints
- SQL injection prevention via Mongoose
- XSS protection through React escaping

### Security Best Practices

```javascript
//  DO: Use environment variables
const secret = process.env.JWT_SECRET;

//  DON'T: Hardcode secrets
const secret = "mysecretkey123";

//  DO: Validate ownership
if (resource.companyName !== user.companyName) {
  return res.status(403).json({ message: 'Not authorized' });
}

//  DON'T: Trust user input
const data = await Model.find({});  // Returns ALL data
```
