|  User Model | Attendance | Leave | Announcement  |
+--------------------------------------------------+
```

### Data Flow
1. Client sends HTTP request with JWT token
2. Auth Middleware validates token and extracts user
3. Controller processes business logic with company filtering
4. Model performs database operations
5. Response sent back to client as JSON
